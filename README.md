# Block Image
A mod that allows you to place an image into a Minecraft world

To use it, type the command
```
/blockimage <position> <imageFile> [<side>] [<width>] [<height>]
```
The <imageFile> argument is a path to an image file. It also has file suggestions so you can navigate your files more easily.

The `[<side>]` argument is the side that the image will be placed, either left or right from your facing direction.

This mod is server-friendly, it will not pull random files from your server.

When you enter the `[<width>]` and `[<height>]`, it will auto-scale the image to fit that size, but if the height is out of the build limit, it will clip the height to the build limit.

Note: Undo feature not supported yet
